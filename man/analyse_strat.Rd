\title{Returns stratification statstics}
\usage{
analyse_strat(data, H_ice = NULL, drho = 0.1, NH = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dataframe; water temperature data in long format with date, depths, value}

\item{H_ice}{vector; of ice thickness which corresponds to date vector, set to NULL if analysis not required. Defaults to NULL}

\item{drho}{numeric; density difference between top and bottom indicating stratificaiton [kg m^-3]}

\item{NH}{boolean; northern hemisphere? TRUE or FALSE. Defaults to true}
}
\description{
Returns stratification statstics: annual mean, max and total
length of summer, winter stratification and ice duration.
NOTE: summer strat periods are allocated to the year in which the period starts. Winter stratification and ice periods are allocated to the year in which they end.
